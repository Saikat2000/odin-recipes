        <li>2 pounds chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups plain yogurt</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. 
            Cut slits into meat and place into a shallow dish.
            Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt.
            Let sit for 20 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together 
            in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring.
            Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours
            (the longer the better).</p></li>
        <li><p>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat
            and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade.
            Discard remaining marinade.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and 
            the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the
            bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with cilantro
            and lemon wedges.</p></li>
